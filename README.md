# February

> [!WARNING]  
> February uses the **development server** from Flask. No production deployment is recommended.

A while back, I spent a lot of time playing with my friends on [bloxd.io](https://bloxd.io). Everyone enjoyed the resource packs, so they began searching for them. However, not long into this, someone's IP address got grabbed. Since we were at school, it wasn't their real IP, but it still raised concerns among everyone. So, I created this proxy. Now, they can still use the resource pack, but their real IP remains hidden. Today, I've decided to release it to the public.

> [!NOTE]  
> February's name is inspired by [January Proxy](https://github.com/revoltchat/january) by Revolt, but that one didn't fit my needs.
